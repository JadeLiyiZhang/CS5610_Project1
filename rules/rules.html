        <h1>Battleship Rules</h1>
        <p>Welcome Aboard, Captain! As the captain of a powerful naval fleet, 
            your mission is to outsmart the enemy and sink their ships before 
            they decimate your own. Strategic planning and a sharp mind will 
            serve as your best tools in this high-seas confrontation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Arrange Your Ships:</span> Place your ships on a 10x10 grid. Your 
                fleet ranges from the nimble Destroyer (2 squares) to the 
                mighty Aircraft Carrier (5 squares).
                Ships can be placed horizontally or vertically but must 
                not overlap or extend off the grid.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Fire at Will:</span> Take turns with your opponent calling out 
                grid coordinates (e.g., B6, H9) to attack.
                Announce "hit" for successful strikes and "miss" for failed attempts.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Track Your Battles:</span> Mark hits and misses on your grid to refine your 
                strategy and deduce the enemy's ship locations.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Report Ship Sinkings:</span> When all parts of a ship are hit, declare it sunk.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Win the War:</span> The first to send all enemy ships to the depths wins. </li>
        </ul>
